# To Do for Affinder and gpt-server

1. update chatbot to keep items: GPT suggestions do not stay in chat history after follow up queries
2. Update block type for variables added from chatbot: GPT suggestions are not imported in the workspace as concept variables.
3. getHighLevelConcepts function doesn't parse the category blocks , may need to update how the workspace is turned into logical code check `lib/detectors/detectors.js`
